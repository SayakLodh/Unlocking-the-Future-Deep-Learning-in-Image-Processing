# Unlocking-the-Future-Deep-Learning-in-Image-Processing

A academic project leveraging a modified CNN model to be trained using datasets (prefferably using X-Ray images) and then the trained model can be saved and used to verify if a person is suffering frtom any medical abnormality.

Dataset: Can be collected via any open source repository or through physical collection of data from various sources. For our use we procured dataset through kaggle.com 1.Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) 2.Tuberculosis (TB) Chest X-ray Database
